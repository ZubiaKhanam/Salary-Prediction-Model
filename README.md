# Salary-Prediction-Model

This linear regression model predicts salary based on years of experience.  For HR professionals, this model offers several potential applications:

* **Salary Benchmarking:**  HR can use the model to benchmark salaries against market rates for specific years of experience, ensuring competitive compensation packages.  This helps attract and retain talent.

* **Salary Planning and Budgeting:**  The model aids in forecasting salary expenses for future hires or promotions, improving budget accuracy and resource allocation.

* **Identifying Salary Discrepancies:**  By comparing actual salaries against predicted values, HR can pinpoint potential salary inequities or anomalies within the organization, helping to ensure fair compensation practices.

* **Performance-Based Salary Adjustments:** The model can help in determining salary adjustments based on experience growth and performance reviews.

* **Negotiation Support:** Provides data-driven insights during salary negotiations with potential candidates or current employees, leading to more objective and fair outcomes.


**Limitations:**  The model's accuracy depends on the quality and representativeness of the input data.  It's crucial to remember that salary is influenced by factors beyond just experience (e.g., location, education, skills, company size and performance, industry, job title).  The model should be used as a tool to inform decisions, not as the sole determinant of salary.  Regularly retraining the model with updated data is necessary to maintain accuracy and relevance.
